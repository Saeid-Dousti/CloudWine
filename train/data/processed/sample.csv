Carter Estate 2011 Penrose Red (South Coast),"This is an intriguing and unique wine with individual elements that are hard to pin down, but worthy of attention.

Seghesio 2009 Zinfandel (Rockpile),"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but that's part of its charm. Without such ripeness, the wine wouldn't have the briary berry, sweet dried currant and leathery flavors. New oak, to the tune of 25%, adds an even richer layer of char. Quite an accomplishment.

Trombetta 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Sizable tannins and oak make for a full-bodied experience that comes off closed and tight at first, the wine needing some time in the glass to unwind.

Pujanza 2009 Norte  (Rioja),"Typical of the best 2009 Riojas, this is aromatic with scents of berry fruits, graphite and spice all mixed to the right proportions. A well-structured palate features firm but flexible tannins and fresh flavors of plum, berry, spice and mocha.

Château Tour des Gendres 2015 La Gloire de Mon Père Red (Côtes de Bergerac),"This well-balanced, deliciously ripe wine is full of black fruit, dark tannins and crisply textured acidity. A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, it's juicy and rich while also poised and stylish. The wood aging shows slightly at the end, along with dry tannins, so it needs to age further.

Domaine Drouhin-Laroze 2010  Chambertin Clos de Bèze,"Powerful while still fruity, this shows acidity and notes of ripe black cherry and spice.

Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),"This needs another year or two in bottle to further integrate the disparate components, especially the aggressive barrel flavors. What's here is all good—vivid, punchy apple fruit, sharp acids and toasty wood notes. There's a hint of vanilla custard and even a suggestion of banana cream pie. It just needs to meld a bit longer and the score could go higher.",90,40.0,Chardonnay,Eola-Amity Hills,Chardonnay-Eola-Amity Hills

Mesh 2012 Riesling (Eden Valley),"Mesh is a partnership between famed Clare Valley Riesling producer Jeffrey Grosset and the Hill Smith family of Yalumba. The 2012 is a solid effort, relatively light in weight but concentrated in flavor, featuring potent notes of lemon and lime sherbet. Very tart and dry on the finish, it needs either oysters or plenty of time in the cellar.",89,,Riesling,Eden Valley,Riesling-Eden Valley
San Felice 2013 Il Grigio Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Smooth and delicious, this boasts enticing scents of violet, berry, leather, tilled soil and aromatic herb.

Martin Ray 2008 Dessert Wine Red (California),"Very sweet, but the raspberry and cherry fruit is thin, making the wine ultimately unsatisfying.",84,18.0,Red Blend,California,Red Blend-California
Poggiarellino 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Ripe plum, game, truffle, leather and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this earthy wine.

Robert Biale 2014 Palisades Vineyard Petite Sirah (Calistoga),"From the eastern side of Calistoga, under the gorgeous geological formation for which the vineyard is named, this wine shows complex, moderately ripe aspects of pencil, leather and youthful, lifted acidity. Grippy still, the Burgundian oak used for aging was 30% new. Elegantly refined, it'll do well with further time in the cellar; enjoy best 2024 through 2034.",94,55.0,Petite Sirah,Calistoga,Petite Sirah-Calistoga
Cantine Leonardo 2008 Da Vinci  (Brunello di Montalcino),"The high acidity on this wine gives it a sharp and steely personality, especially on first impression. Those sharp edges will soften with time but the wine already shows slightly aged aromas of candied berries, tar, tobacco and leather. Pair it with creamy pasta dishes.",88,60.0,Sangiovese Grosso,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso-Brunello di Montalcino
Lava Cap 2013 American River Red (El Dorado),"This wine is well made in the lightly sweet but full-bodied style. It has plenty of ripe fruit flavors, high alcohol and moderate tannins to add texture.",87,18.0,Red Blend,El Dorado,Red Blend-El Dorado
Meridian 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"From this always dependable producer comes this lovely, supple wine. There are plenty of bright, ripe raspberry, black-cherry and cola flavors nuanced by smoke and spice notes from oak.

Merryvale 2008 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"A rare Cabernet Franc from Merry-vale, and a spectacular one. They've handled this finicky variety just right, although surely the addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec adds weight and tone. The wine is dry, richly tannic and enormously flavorful, offering waves of cherries, red currants, red licorice, cola, sweet cedar wood and even savory hints of bacon. A tremendous Cabernet Franc that will stand as a definitive version in California.",95,90.0,Cabernet Franc,Napa Valley,Cabernet Franc-Napa Valley

Pascal Aufranc 2012 Les Cerisiers Vieilles  Vignes  (Juliénas),"This wine's name translates to “cherry,” and cherries are in its aroma along with spice.

It's a fine wine, but not for long-term aging so drink now and over the next few months.",89,20.0,Gamay,Juliénas,Gamay-Juliénas
Dilecta 2014 Cookie Red (Central Coast),"Aromas of vanilla-flecked and butter-laced pastry filled with cassis sauce show on the nose of this rich blend of 62% Syrah and 38% Mourvèdre from the Bien Nacido and Jada vineyards.

The Boneyard 2013 Skins Rkatsiteli (Monticello),"This Rkatsiteli was cold soaked for 11 days on the skins (hence the name) and then aged in barrels for 15 months.

Masciarelli 2003 Marina Cvetic Chardonnay (Colline Teatine),"This is a showcase wine for the region of Abruzzo that delivers mature notes of peach, rounded toasted notes of honey and pear.

A to Z 2006 Riesling (Oregon),"Tart and racy, this sets up the palate for spicy fare with bracing acids and scents of citrus skins.

Flavors mix citrus, white flowers, strawberries and spice, with a finishing lick of minerality.",88,13.0,Riesling,Oregon,Riesling-Oregon
Marqués de Gelida 2009 Pinot Noir Brut Reserva Rosé Sparkling (Cava),"Modest and generally clean on the nose, this features little more than a touch of berry.

Von Strasser 2012 Sori Bricco Vineyard Red (Diamond Mountain District),"Almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec, with a smaller make-up of Merlot, this wine tastes of an Italian deli somehow, offering a wealth of black olive and antipasti.

William Hill Estate 2013 Benchland Series Malbec (Napa Valley),"Subdued red fruit is kept fresh by moderate acidity in this boldly dense and grippy wine rich in violet aromas.

The Withers Winery 2013 English Hill Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Made by David Low of Anthill Farms in extremely small quantities, this is a new brand devoted to light-bodied wines from fine, cool-climate sites.

Rivetto 2008 Leon Riserva  (Barolo),"Underbrush, tobacco leaf, leather, truffle and blackberry aromas take center stage along with whiffs of toast and fig.

Bridgeview 2006 Gewürztraminer (Southern Oregon),"This is an odd duck for Gewürz; lacking any of the floral character generally associated with that grape. It's lemony and slightly sweet, with good acid. It makes a pleasant, if generic white wine to accompany spicy noodles or light seafood.",83,10.0,Gewürztraminer,Southern Oregon,Gewürztraminer-Southern Oregon
N. Kendall Wines 2015 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"There's not a lot of embellishment on this steely, tightly structured Chardonnay but its transparency is quite enthralling.

Meadowcroft 2014 Louvau Vineyard Viognier (Dry Creek Valley),"This 100% varietal wine makes the case for Viognier in this appellation, expressing Golden Delicious apple and pear around a fresh, medium build of viscous texture, lemon and wild honey.

Rotta 2013 Osso Balenda Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Intoxicating aromas of plum jelly, violets, blueberry, chocolate and cinnamon are cut with a pencil-lead focus on this bottling by a family in the Paso wine game since 1908. Flavors of blackberry jelly are lifted by lavender and anise spice.",92,40.0,Zinfandel,Paso Robles,Zinfandel-Paso Robles
Cascina Bruciata 2011 Cannubi Muscatel  (Barolo),"This opens with aromas of ripe berry, aromatic herb, pressed rose petal and a balsamic note. The rather lean palate offers sour cherry, crushed strawberry, sage and star anise alongside nervous acidity and tightly wound, astringent tannins that leave a rather raspy finish.

Château Roullet 2010  Canon-Fronsac,"This is an enormous wine, maybe too much. With its layers of rich black fruits and dark tannins, it is a powerful, juicy, jammy and super-ripe wine. It all seems excessive and out of balance. It's fun for a moment, but not for drinking with food.",85,65.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Canon-Fronsac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend-Canon-Fronsac
Capafons-Ossó 2003 Mas de Masos Red (Priorat),"Big, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.",91,70.0,Red Blend,Priorat,Red Blend-Priorat
Collis 2015 Scaligeri Decanto  (Soave),"Aromas of grilled herb, mature orchard fruit and citrus lead the nose while the palate offers Bartlett pear and nectarine zest. Notes of white almond and a hint of mineral signal the close.",88,,Garganega,Soave,Garganega-Soave
Frazier 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization.

Raphael 2014 Reserve Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"This stand-out Cabernet Franc offers the structure and savory nuance of the Old World, but alongside a palate that's lusciously concentrated with ripe, succulent black fruit. Whiffs of violet and tea leaf reverberate from nose to finish, along with a bold yet velvet frame of tannins.

D'Arenberg 2008 The Last Ditch Viognier (McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills),"Barrel fermented in older oak, but this wine is still marked by oak and lees, with a slightly toasty, custardy edge to the melon and nectarine aromas and flavors.

esedos 2011 Prieto Picudo (Spain),"Aromatically, this varietal Prieto Picudo from Asturias shows graphite, wood resin, vanilla and spiced plum. In the mouth, however, it's devoid of structure and thus comes across jammy and flabby. Flavors of baked berry fruits are oaky and rooty, while this is massive on the finish but lacks foundation and framing.",84,50.0,Prieto Picudo,Spain,Prieto Picudo-Spain
Omero 2014 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is a pretty, light-copper hue, from a small percentage of the grapes being kept on the skins.

Testarossa 2014 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Comprised solely of the richer 667 clone, this bottling from the Talley family's iconic vineyard offers juicy blackberry, chipped slate, fennel frond and cola notes on the nose.

Château les Verriers 2014  Bordeaux,"This is a light, fruity wine that is likely to be drinkable very soon. It does have a rustic edge although that is likely to blow away in the coming months.

Ochoa 2012 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra),"Whereas once Ochoa produced some of Navarra's best rosés, lately the wines have been marginal. This is awkward, with aromas of chemicals and rubber gloves.

Quady North 2012 Cabernet Franc (Applegate Valley),"Fresh fruit flavors of red apple and raspberry carry the wine into a light, fairly brief finish.

Butterfly Kiss 2011 Pinot Grigio (California),"This is easy to drink, with crisp, mouthwatering acidity that brightens the lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors.

Domaines Schlumberger 2012 Kessler Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane.",92,30.0,Pinot Gris,Alsace,Pinot Gris-Alsace
Marietta Cellars NV Old Vine Red Lot 66 Red (California),"It's great to return to an excellent honest-tasting fruit-driven wine that has very good balance, an appetizing texture thanks to fine-grained tannins and light spicy elements to complement the pure cherry and berry core.

Drew 2011 Weir Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yorkville Highlands),"A bright Pinot from a great spot, this wine takes a while to open, especially aromatically, but once it does it has a lot to say. Structured and soft, it's meaty in savory cranberry and earth, bright with fruit and acidity.

The combination of the two makes this as tough as any young Napa Valley Cabernet could be.

It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish.

Gary Farrell 2013 Gap's Crown Vineyard Clone 667 Three Barrel Selection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is another of the producer's intellectual exercises in experimental winemaking, made in tiny case-production numbers.

B Cellars 2004 Blend 26 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The grapes come from three vineyards: Georges III in Rutherford, Tokalon in Oakville and Stagecoach, up on Atlas Peak. That helps explain the wine's beauty. It's pure California, cult-style Cab, soft and generous, with voluptuously ripe black currant and black cherry flavors elaborately enriched with spicy, smoky, 100% new French oak.

Château Lilian Ladouys 2010  Saint-Estèphe,"Obviously wood-aged, with a smoky toast flavor, this is a wine that shows the power of Saint-Estèphe tannins in full force.

Nieto Senetiner 2007 Cadus Single Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),"Supersaturated, so much so that it's opaque, with blackberry, horseradish and chocolate aromas.

Boekenoogen 2014 Bell Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Monterey),"The nose and palate of this wine are quite mellow for the first few hours after opening but grow more compelling with time, so decanting is strongly recommended.

Adelsheim 2008 Caitlin's Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Still quite young yet unmistakably lush, this bottling immediately shows fresh apples, white peach and plenty of new oak from 100% barrel fermentation.

Vellum 2012 Black Petit Verdot (Suisun Valley),"A very dry and firmly tannic wine, this doesn't give up much aroma, and the flavors also seem bound up with the astringent texture. With a bit of time some blueberry and blackberry aromas emerge, and flavors of black olive, too. This wine seems to require the most marbled steak to balance its austerity in texture, or perhaps 10 years in a cool cellar.",85,75.0,Petit Verdot,Suisun Valley,Petit Verdot-Suisun Valley
Marqués de Almonacid 2012 Vendimia Seleccionada San Nicolás De Tolentino Garnacha-Tempranillo (Cariñena),"Dense blackberry, licorice, leather and herb aromas come together nicely on this Garnacha-Tempranillo blend.

Evesham Wood 1998 Le Puits Sec Cuvée J Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Very pungent aromas, with piercing red fruit and light touches of citrus on the nose. At first it’s shockingly tart and tight, so much so that it might throw you for a loop. After lots of time it breathes itself to life, where raspberry essence rises up.

Roadhouse Winery 2014 Platinum Pinot Noir (Yorkville Highlands),"Flavor complexity is the strong suit of this multi-layered and distinctive wine.

Scratch 2014 Rosé Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed.

Fritz 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"Good for Fritz for holding this Cab back for a few years to let it mellow.

Duckhorn 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This wine is well sourced, its grapes coming from Brown Ranch, Toyon and Trefethen, among other sites.

Swanson 2010 Instant Napa Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"It's not clear what Swanson means by the word “instant,” although this blend, which contains some Merlot and Petit Verdot, is rich enough in blackberries, cherries and mocha to enjoy now.
