108457,France,"A structured wine, with some tight black cherry flavors as well as firm tannins. The wine has a mineral edge, the acidity giving a juicy character to the fruit, while the texture is dry, tannic.

118663,Austria,"Fleshy, ripe notes of yellow pear lead to a yeasty palate that fizzes with citric lift. Lively and fresh, light-footed, concentrated and energetic, this is a sip of Austrian life. The extra dollop of fresh acidity brightens the entire wine and makes for very appetizing, spicy drinking with a zesty finish.",Privat Reserve,91,25.0,Kremstal,,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Aigner 2014 Privat Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),Grüner Veltliner,Aigner

62668,Greece,"The Savatiano-whisperer Papagiannakos continues his mastery here, traditionally the variety used for retsina. Here, the single variety is barrel fermented and left on the lees to offer a richer expression of the grape's lemon, spice and peach notes. This is an elegant white with aging ability.

29530,France,"This light-colored wine is attractively perfumed but with a grassy edge that suggests the fruit was underripe. Built for the short term, it will be ready from late 2017.",,84,19.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Pierre Gruber 2014  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,Pierre Gruber

22751,New Zealand,"Starts off tight, only stubbornly giving up hints of kerosene and unripe peaches—the rock-hard kind you see on sale for a price that's too good to be true.
