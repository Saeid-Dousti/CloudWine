Fabre Montmayou 2011 Phebus Estate Bottled Malbec (Río Negro Valley),"Jammy berry and cassis aromas come with a bit of leather and horse hide. This brings it on the palate, but there isn't much finesse to the mix of blackberry and baked plum flavors along with hard tannins. Give this time in the glass and it opens up and mellows out.",88,16.0,Malbec,Río Negro Valley,Malbec-Río Negro Valley
L'Ecole No. 41 2011 Estate Grown Seven Hills Vineyard Perigee Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, it's still a big, tough, chewy, tannic wine with a chunky, somewhat blocky mouthfeel. Cherry, cassis and wood flavors dominate, and the tannins are quite astringent. Re-tasted over many hours it remained stubbornly hard and compact. Give this one some further bottle age.",90,50.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend-Walla Walla Valley (WA)

Hartford 2007 Jennifer's Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"One of the ripest of Hartford's new Pinots, this is a full-bodied and very rich wine. It offers extreme flavor in place of subtlety, offering a massive palate wash of blackberries and cherries that veers into Lifesaver candy. The bet is ageability.

Rochioli 2010 South River Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A spectacular Chardonnay—this is dazzingly beautiful and mesmerizing in its appeal.

Taittinger NV Nocturne Sec  (Champagne),"In the strange world of Champagne, Sec (dry) on the label means a wine that is less dry than Brut. It is more to do with fullness and weight than sugar. This wine bears ripe fruit, flavors of peaches, creamy pears and light nougat and spice character. Pair this with richly sauced foods.",90,100.0,Champagne Blend,Champagne,Champagne Blend-Champagne

It will make a fine summer apéritif.",85,10.0,Rosé,Côtes de Provence,Rosé-Côtes de Provence
Ruca Malen 2011 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Compact, gritty, stalky aromas are hard and herbal. This feels narrow and short on body, while flavors of generic berry fruits are a bit green and low on richness and depth. Oaky vanilla notes drive the finish.",87,19.0,Malbec,Mendoza,Malbec-Mendoza

Villa Gianna 2011 Nobilvite  (Circeo),Nobilvite (Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) offers slightly disjointed aromas of black fruit and prune backed by green olive and caper. There's a touch of sourness on the otherwise short finish.,84,10.0,Red Blend,Circeo,Red Blend-Circeo
Domaine Serene 1999 Cote Sud Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This seems a bit overripe in the nose; definitely an ultraripe style, with flavors of peach, apricot and mango.

Benoît Girard 2014  Sancerre,"Part of the same family business as Philippe Girard's wines (Benoît is his brother), this is a ripe, pure and clean wine.

Ruca Malen 2004 Kinien Malbec (Mendoza),"Fruity and earthy, with sly, narrow flavors of blackberry and chocolate.

Ruca Malen 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Mendoza),"A more than solid wine cut from the tropical, South American blueprint. It's open and full of banana, pear and apple aromas, and while it runs hot and fast on the palate, it's got lots of woody, ripe flavors of apple and pithy citrus. Round, lively and packed with flavor even if it shows almost nothing in common with cool-climate Chardonnay.",88,18.0,Chardonnay,Mendoza,Chardonnay-Mendoza
Niner 2014 JR Reserve Grenache (Edna Valley),"This bottling from the cool-climate Jespersen Ranch offers baked black cherry, graphite, gingerbread and vanilla on the nose. There's a kick of white pepper on the palate, possibly owing to the 10% Syrah that's blended in, along with dark boysenberry fruit. The texture is grippy and serious for the grape.",91,50.0,Grenache,Edna Valley,Grenache-Edna Valley

Marqués de Cáceres 2007 Reserva Especial Edición Limitada  (Rioja),"Dense black-fruit aromas are potent but limited in scope and elegance. In the mouth, this is saturated, creamy and oaky.

Clos du Val 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Clos du Val has gone as far as they intend to in order to make a ripe, opulent Cab in the modern Napa cult style. But they remain faithful to their Bordeaux-inspired house style, which is leaner and more tannic than most. The result is a natural cellar candidate, with an official alcohol of only 13.5%. Rich in blackberries and black currants, this wine should easily develop over the next 10–15 years.",94,70.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon-Stags Leap District

Domaine Ostertag 2015 Les Vieilles Vignes Sylvaner (Alsace),"Brilliant, crystalline freshness tinged with chervil and lemon is the impression on the nose.

Maison L'Envoyé 2012 Two Messengers Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A forward, softly fruity wine closer to California Pinot than most Oregon examples.

Ruca Malen 2008 Kinien Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"This rooty smelling wine delivers herb, cola and cassis aromas in front of a wiry feeling palate that's loaded to the brim with hard-biting tannins. Flavors of mossy, baked berry fruits come with an herbal streak, and the finish is hard due to those grating tannins. For a five-year-old wine to feel this hard is telling.",87,48.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon-Mendoza

Conn Creek 2005 Anthology Red (Napa Valley),"A sad approximation of the old Anthology, whose quality has been sinking in recent years.

Cobb 2012 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone.

Sineann 2010 Resonance Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This young wine may need more time to reveal itself; though Resonance is proven as a top vineyard, here it seems shuttered and not yet woven together.

Poggio San Polo 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,"Initial traces of smoky sulfur need to blow off and once they do this Brunello freely exhibits tones of blackberry, prunes and smoked bacon.

Iris Vineyards 2014 Aroha Vineyard Pinot Gris (Umpqua Valley),"Significantly riper than the winery's two other Pinot Gris releases, this seems a bit flat in comparison.

The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years.

An earthy quality shades modest cherry flavors, while hints of clove and cinnamon add complexity.",83,50.0,Pinot Noir,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir-Anderson Valley
Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2013 Adènzia Red (Sicilia),"A fifty-fifty blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this accessible wine offers aromas that recall tilled soil, black-skinned berry, blue flower and spice.

Best after 2017.",93,50.0,Syrah,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah-Walla Walla Valley (WA)
I Capitani 2007 Bosco Faiano  (Taurasi),"This jammy wine doles out overripe plum and mature dark-berry fruit, layered with a melted chocolate sensation. Warm and evolved, it has an almost sugary-sweet palate that's shy on freshness.",87,36.0,Aglianico,Taurasi,Aglianico-Taurasi
Styring 2013 Signature Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Sexy and seductive, this melds cherry fruit with a touch of white pepper, blossoming into a full midpalate with length and power.

Star Lane Vineyard 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Dark, full-bodied and a little ponderous, showing firm tannins and blackberry, blueberry, plum, mocha and spice flavors that finish dry and spicy.

J. Christopher 2011 Sandra Adele Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This cuvée is not as ripe as it was in the 2010 vintage. It has a pleasant tomato-soup character—a mix of ripe tomato and light, fresh flavors of basil and cilantro. It also has plenty of tart cherry flavors filling in the midpalate, and is well proportioned for drinking over the next few years.",88,52.0,Pinot Noir,Dundee Hills,Pinot Noir-Dundee Hills
Zotovich Cellars 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Very focused Key-lime aromas meet with strongly earthy, wet-clay scents on the nose of this wine that also offers a subtle minty kick. The palate is citrus-driven, with kumquat and tangerine flavors that give way to a warmer cream element before settling on a tense pink-grapefruit pith element.",93,36.0,Chardonnay,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay-Sta. Rita Hills
Buglioni 2009 Il Valpolicella  (Valpolicella Classico),"Embodies all the easy-drinking informality of the Italian wines we knew 20 or 30 years ago.

Barbour 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Flashy, soft and luscious, this is made in the modern cult style of Napa Cabernet.

Tussock Jumper 2013 Moscato Rosé (Valencia),"While this foamy rosé is not elevated, it should appeal to those who like sweet Moscato bubblies. Candied flavors of raspberry, lychee and dried mango finish with a note of pineapple syrup.",85,11.0,Rosé,Valencia,Rosé-Valencia
Dutton Estate 2014 Thomas Road Vineyard Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This vineyard-designate opens in bombastic amounts of Asian spice and wild strawberry, making for a whirlwind of flavor and acidity on the palate.

Pine Ridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Tastes like sweet, spicy blackberry jam, with an overripe note of prune lurking in the background, which will limit the wine's age-­worthiness.

Gaintza 2014 Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina),"Briny, leesy aromas are funky and sweaty, not clean and lean like most Txakoli. Snappy, citric and decidedly not spritzy, this tastes of lemon, underripe nectarine and tart green apple.

Château d'Aydie 2007 Tannat (Madiran),"Powerfully rich, with plenty of the dry tannins of Tannat, but also rich sweet plum fruits and concentrated wood to soften and round.

Bodegas Fabre 2013 Phebus Gran Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"With an opaque purple color and boysenberry aromas that include notes of raisin and prune, this obtuse, chunky Malbec shows hard tannins and deep, dark flavors of black olive, fig, prune and roasted meat.

Lonia NV Brut Reserva Selección de la Familia Sparkling (Cava),"Solid white-fruit aromas blend with a grassy note of hay as well as dusty floral scents.

Jean-Baptiste Adam 2016 Les Natures Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Honey, peach and honeysuckle create a very rich aromatic nose. The medium-sweet palate amplifies them all and presents them on an almost oily, rich and fluid body. A bitter phenolic edge provides backbone. The finish is full of peach, zest and freshness.",90,25.0,Gewürztraminer,Alsace,Gewürztraminer-Alsace

Cueva de las Manos 2007 Reserve Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.",85,15.0,Malbec,Luján de Cuyo,Malbec-Luján de Cuyo
Bodegas San Valero 2013 Particular Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena),"Oak-heavy wood spice, plum and leather aromas open this Garnacha.

Pine Ridge 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"From a steep, densely planted estate vineyard, this is a lilting regional example of well-integrated oak in support of black raspberry, licorice and chalky clove.

Mirabelle NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Coast),"Here's a very rich, full-bodied blush bubbly that really satisfies for sheer deliciousness. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, its creamy texture holds flavors of limes, raspberries, vanilla and yeasty lees.

Crisp and a good food wine.",87,22.0,Tempranillo,Rioja,Tempranillo-Rioja
Donum 2012 West Slope Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Substantive in oak and weight, this concentrated, estate-grown wine is impressive in velvety texture and a savory conjuring of tobacco and black tea. Dark, brambly blackberry and dark cherry join in on the fun, providing vibrancy amid all the sophistication. Finishing with a dash of cardamom, this wine will cellar nicely through 2020.",93,90.0,Pinot Noir,Carneros,Pinot Noir-Carneros
Maryhill 2011 Northridge Primitivo (Wahluke Slope),"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this vineyard-designated wine doesn't seem entirely ripe, displaying notes of herbs, cranberry and red fruit.

Rocky Gully 2006 Dry Riesling (Frankland River),"A little less austere and easier to drink than many dry Aussie Rieslings, this wine features lime and vanilla shadings on the nose, and ample apple, melon and citrus flavors.

Winderlea 2007 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Half the fruit is sourced from the Carabella vineyard, half from the Hyland vineyard. This is a young, tense, tight wine, still melding itself together. Melon, green pineapple, green banana and Streaks of butter and toast suggest that all the right flavor components are in place. The wine remains steely and compressed; definitely a white wine that should be decanted.",89,30.0,Chardonnay,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay-Willamette Valley
Cascina Luisin 2012 Asili  (Barbaresco),"Aromas of resin, nail polish remover and violet lead the nose while the nervous palate delivers raw red cherry, toasted oak, coconut and cooking spice.

Luigi Bosca 2014 Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Reedy red-fruit aromas are woody and a touch medicinal. This feels round but edgy, with grabby prodding tannins. Savory herbal berry flavors with salted plum notes finish with overt oak and rubbery tannins.",88,22.0,Malbec,Luján de Cuyo,Malbec-Luján de Cuyo
Abbaye Sylva Plana 2009 La Closeraie Red (Faugères),"Heady but juicy Grenache dominates the blend of this wine, which also includes 30% Cinsault, 15% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre.

Armanino Family Cellars 2009 The Whitewing Amber Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's a burnt, ashy smell and taste to this wine that makes it tough to like.

Les Vignobles Gueissard 2012 Les Papilles Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"A rich and food friendly style of rosé, its initial red fruitiness hiding a more serious, textured character of minerality and elegance. It would be worth aging this fine rosé for a few months.",89,,Rosé,Côtes de Provence,Rosé-Côtes de Provence
Blanchard Family 2010 Cash Allen Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill),"There's a hardness to this Cabernet that comes from the tannins as well as brisk acidity.

Viña Albali 2006 Reserva Red (Valdepeñas),"Light on fruit but loaded with mocha and milk chocolate aromas.

World's End 2009 Wavelength Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard Syrah-Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This is one of the most successful Syrah-Cabernet Franc blends in California.

Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Baccante White (Sicilia),"From one of Sicily's most beautiful and promising vineyards, Baccante is a blend of Grillo and Chardonnay with bright clean acidity and fragrant yellow fruit.

Ken Wright 2010 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A marvelous vintage for Freedom Hill, this high-acid Pinot is loaded with black cherry fruit. Rich, ripe, full, tart and penetrating, it might seem one-dimensional at first, but it has such excellent focus and depth that the fruit simply rocks.

Acacia 2006 St. Clair Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Very dry, tart and brittle, this Pinot, from a famous old vineyard that pioneered the Napa side of Carneros, isn't very lush right now.

Concannon 2006 Reserve Grenache (Monterey County),"Grenache's main duty is to deliver cherry flavors, and this one over-performs in that category.

Fast and flavorful, but edgy.",86,22.0,Sparkling Blend,Cava,Sparkling Blend-Cava
Verité 2008 La Muse Red (Sonoma County),"A pinch of hard tannins gives this bone-dry young wine an astringent toughness. It shows very fine, concentrated black-cherry, cocoa and crème de cassis flavors. Aging in almost 100% new French oak adds notes of toast that the fruit easily tolerates.

Chacewater 2014 Organic Grapes Rosé (Sierra Foothills),"This has a candied cherry color, vivid strawberry and cotton candy aromas, and on first sip a freshness that's almost startling. On second sip it's more like a light red wine, delicate, medium-bodied, very fruity but easy on the palate.",87,17.0,Rosé,Sierra Foothills,Rosé-Sierra Foothills
Costers del Siurana 2007 Kyrie White (Priorat),"This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?",88,78.0,White Blend,Priorat,White Blend-Priorat
Mas de Gourgonnier 2012 Rosé (Les Baux de Provence),"This is a lively, ripe, fruity wine that has both richness and freshness in equal measure. The wine is warm, but with delicate fruitiness from crisp red fruit. Drink this wine soon.",88,18.0,Rosé,Les Baux de Provence,Rosé-Les Baux de Provence
Vinum 2016 Rosé (Paso Robles),"Tight citrus aromas meet with bubblegum and wet stone on the somewhat reserved though clean and inviting nose of this wine. The flavors are also quite light, with strawberry and lemon touches, so the point is more of the racy acidity and slight tannic grip.",86,14.0,Rosé,Paso Robles,Rosé-Paso Robles
Atalon 2006 Corestone Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Dramatic all around. Deeply aromatic, offering waves of grilled blackberries, currants, violets, sweet buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood. The tannin structure is superb. Feels classically dense and full-bodied in the mouth, very dry, yet opulent and complex. Grows more concentrated as it airs in the glass. A tremendous wine that needs time. 2012–2020.",96,60.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon-Napa Valley

Chehalem 2015 Ridgecrest Vineyards Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"This wine's tangy raspberry and cherry fruit is front and center, with a vein of rich chocolate underneath. Dominated by acidity now, with oak and tannin components not fully integrated, it clearly needs more time to pull itself together and should reward further bottle age.",89,50.0,Pinot Noir,Ribbon Ridge,Pinot Noir-Ribbon Ridge
El Nido 2012 Red (Jumilla),"Giant out of the blocks, this full-bodied, midnight-black bruiser delivers a heavy blast of graphite, vanilla, coconut, char and blackberry on the nose. A heavy, tannic, borderline syrupy palate is appropriate for flavors of toasted coconut, vanilla and oak. A chocolaty finish loaded with barrel resin is rich and heady. This is an extracted heavyweight from a warm year. Some will love it; others will find it too oaky and overripe. Drink through 2021.",90,130.0,Red Blend,Jumilla,Red Blend-Jumilla
Mario Bazán 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A little aggressive in feline spray notes, but pulls back just in time to let the gooseberry, grapefruit, lemon and lime flavors star. Crisp acidity provides fortunate balance to this sweetly fruit wine.",86,20.0,Sauvignon Blanc,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc-Napa Valley
Nicosia 2011 Rosso  (Etna),"Aromas of toasted oak, mint, vanilla and dried berry lead the nose and continue to the palate along with coffee and anise notes. It's rather austere and lacks fruit richness.",87,,Red Blend,Etna,Red Blend-Etna

Lionel Osmin & Cie 2011 Mon Adour Tannat (Madiran),"Almost black in color, this very dense, complex wine is tough at this young stage.

Le Salette 2009 I Progni  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"This delivers about the same intensity and concentration as a top shelf Amarone—but for half the price.

Sartori 2001 Corte Brà  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This wine has a leg up on the competition thanks to its elegance. Vibrant ruby red in color, its aromas include ripe cherry, milk chocolate, leather, tobacco and Indian spice.

Your first impression is of ripe raspberries and cherries that taste like they were baked into a pie. Then layers of minerals, mushrooms, cola and earthier fruits like persimmons and rhubarbs appear, all made brisk by amazing acidity and finishing bone dry. Lovely now and over the next six years, after an hour or two in the decanter.",92,59.0,Pinot Noir,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir-Santa Lucia Highlands
Frey 2013 Organic Petite Sirah (Redwood Valley),"Once past an element of burnt rubber that mingles with the ripe blackberry aromas, this becomes a hearty and concentrated wine yet one with very moderate alcohol.

Francis Coppola 2014 Dutton Ranch Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"From a fine vineyard site, this wine impresses in voluptuous texture and its lovely layers of lemon and apple.

Torbreck 2010 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"A perplexing wine to evaluate, the 2010 RunRig (97% Shiraz and 3% Viognier) evolves rapidly once poured, going from slightly stewed and overoaked to a wine that shows considerable class within 20 minutes or so.

It's made for sheer drinking pleasure so enjoy soon.",89,21.0,Lagrein,Alto Adige,Lagrein-Alto Adige
Domaine du Trapadis 2005 Rasteau Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"Despite a hefty dose of Grenache (60%), this is a dark, forboding wine, loaded with earthy notes and a full, firm, somewhat stern mouthfeel. It's impressive for its concentration and clearly needs time in the bottle, but it's unclear if it will ever offer truly hedonistic drinking. Imported by International Gourmet Corp.",87,20.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Côtes du Rhône Villages,Rhône-style Red Blend-Côtes du Rhône Villages
Volker Eisele Family Estate 2007 Terzetto Red (Napa Valley),"Rough-hewn and tannic in youth, this blend of one-third each Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot isn't showing much accessibility. It's astringently closed, but very ripe and sweet in blackberries, cherries and cedar. Give it five years in the cellar.",90,75.0,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend-Napa Valley
Domaine des Baumard 2009  Quarts de Chaume,"The Quarts de Chaume are four ridges that jut out into the Layon valley, subject to botrytis because of the mists that come from the valley floor. This fine example is smooth, opulent and unctuous in character, a richly sweet wine. It is full of noble rot while also exhibiting the all-important acidity. Honey, ripe peaches, pineapple are still prominent. Give it 5–7 years. Screwcap.",94,,Chenin Blanc,Quarts de Chaume,Chenin Blanc-Quarts de Chaume
Farina 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"This Amarone has ripe blackberry aromas, with hints of raisin and spice. The palate shows black cherry, black pepper and prune notes.

Duckhorn 2010 Three Palms Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Hard tannins give taut astringency to this wine. But then, that's the signature of Three Palms, which always starts life tight and tough. Made since 1978 by Duckhorn, the wine has shown a consistency rare among Merlot single-vineyard bottlings. This 2010 shows Three Palm's hard tannins, but has such lush black cherry and mocha fruit that it's easy to drink now. It's a worthy followup to the magnificent 2009, but better structured. Drink now–2020.",94,90.0,Merlot,Napa Valley,Merlot-Napa Valley
Cass 2005 Rockin' One Red (Paso Robles),"A blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this has a chocolate mint edge to the sugary sweet LifeSaver candy blackberries and cherries. The tannins and acids are good, though, and the wine would score higher if it were drier.",84,42.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Paso Robles,Rhône-style Red Blend-Paso Robles
Sylvaine et Alain Normand 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé,"This wine is well balanced, ripe with apricot and white-peach flavors that contrast with the kiwi and grapefruit freshness.

Kalaris 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tannic, dry and acidic now, this doesn't offer much of the immediate opulence found in many California Pinot Noirs. The richness is in there, but it's buried. The sweet core of cherries, currants, exotic spices, mushrooms and minerals is just waiting for time to release it. Cellar this for 6–8 years.",90,55.0,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir-Sonoma Coast
Signorello 1998 Hope's Cuvée Chardonnay (California),"This massively oaky wine smells like an explosion in a spice factory, with ginger, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg aromas, accented by vanilla, brown sugar, butterscotch and honey.

Stony Lonesome 2015 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Intensely fruity, almost tropical, on the nose, this juicy Chardonnay is chock full of fresh pineapple, melon and mango flavors.

Buglioni 2010 Il Valpolicella  (Valpolicella Classico),"Although this wine sees contact with stainless steel only (no oak), there is a carbonized, toasted quality to the fruit regardless.

Tranche 2010 Blue Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine leads with somewhat locked-up, slightly porty aromas of herb, barrel spice and dark fruit.

Viña Olabarri 2011 Crianza  (Rioja),"Toasty, warm, charred aromas accent earthy, enticing plum and prune scents.

Eufloria 2013 Aromatic Blend White (Washington),"This off-dry blend of Riesling, Chenin Blanc, Pinot Gris and Muscat shows the last grape first and foremost.

The wine is aromatic as promised, delicate and tilting toward the floral, though with good, solid fruit structure.",89,14.0,White Blend,Washington,White Blend-Washington
So Rare 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Here's a soft, luscious Cabernet. It has soft tannins and is very delicious, with a milk chocolate edge to the black and red sour-cherry candy fruit, enriched with rich, toasty oak.

Costa de Oro 2010 Estate Gold Coast Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Despite having a wealth of cherry and sweet, smoky oak flavors, unripe notes of green peppercorn and tomato mark this Pinot Noir.

Boheme 2012 Taylor Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Dark gold in color and perfumed on the nose in a mix of apple blossom and sea spray, this wine is aged in a majority of seasoned French oak and a third stainless steel.

Custard 2013 Comfort Wine Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Fuzzy stone fruit from apricot to peach dominate on the nose and palate in this straightforward, creamy and richer-styled wine.

Domaine Anderson 2013 Pinoli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Tangy cherry flavors and a lip-smacking texture give a lot of life to this medium-bodied, tight and balanced wine. Great vibrancy comes from fruit flavors that are not overly ripe, and from moderate tannins and lively acidity that keep the mouthfeel fresh. A wonderful creaminess coats the tongue on the finish. Best after 2018.",93,65.0,Pinot Noir,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir-Anderson Valley
De Faveri 2015 Dry  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze),"Jasmine, aromatic herb and pear aromas waft out of the glass.

Valley of the Moon 2004 Syrah (Sonoma County),"There's value for the money in this smooth wine. It smacks of cherries, not the darker, deeper fruits of Syrah, but it does have a complex leathery, meaty edge. The tannin-acid balance is just right, and leads to a simple, fruity finish.",86,16.0,Syrah,Sonoma County,Syrah-Sonoma County
Bibbiano 2012 Montornello  (Chianti Classico),"Crushed blue flower, ripe plum and baking spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this polished red.

Sojourn 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"From a selection of vineyard-designated sites, including Durell, Campbell Ranch and several Sangiacomo sites, this well-crafted blend is buzzing in minerality, a wet-stone character that overlays a depth of silky richness.

Rochioli 2010 West Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"We can quibble over whether the cherries are red or black, or if it's persimmons or pomegranates, or if the mushrooms are fresh or sautéed, but that's the point. This wine is so complex, it initiates discussion. Fine acidity and rich tannins provide structure, and although the wine is silky enough to enjoy now, you really want to give it 6–8 years.",96,100.0,Pinot Noir,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir-Russian River Valley
Jamieson Ranch 2013 Light Horse Pinot Noir (California),"A smoky, oaky aroma leads to meaty flavors with notes of rhubarb and red cherries. The texture is on the soft side and the body is medium.

Gratia 2011 Raftacco Vineyards Malbec (Mendoza),"Raspberry, blackberry and tobacco aromas settle in front of a chewy, round, solidly built palate.

Drink through 2021.",92,40.0,Malbec,Mendoza,Malbec-Mendoza
Scott Harvey 2014 Vineyard 1869 Zinfandel (Amador County),"This is a great example of a dry well-balanced Zin to drink with dinner rather than as a sweet dessert. It's also a taste of history, coming from a vineyard originally planted in 1869. It's medium bodied, nicely structured with firm tannins and has aromatic complexity from cedar, tobacco and cardamom notes, plus delicious just-ripe cherry flavors.",93,48.0,Zinfandel,Amador County,Zinfandel-Amador County
Bibbiano 2007 Montornello  (Chianti Classico),There's an interesting mineral element here that pops straight through the wine's deep concentration and natural richness.

The wine's drying finish and satin texture add to its overall appeal.,87,,Sangiovese,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese-Chianti Classico
Aiken 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Still young and tight, this cassis-laden wine has a softness, complemented by herb and dusty tannin.

E. Guigal 2011 Château d'Ampuis  (Côte Rôtie),"The essence of the appellation smokes out from the glass, offering hints of cracked pepper, bacon, clove and leather. It's reasonably full-bodied for Côte Rôtie, with feral, smoked-meat flavors, ample spice and plenty of the concentrated plummy fruit. Tannins are silky, making this approachable now, but likely capable of aging well for at least 10–15 years.",94,75.0,Rhône-style Red Blend,Côte Rôtie,Rhône-style Red Blend-Côte Rôtie
Máté 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sant'Antimo),"A lovely Cab from Montalcino, with bright berry aromas of blackberry and wild cherry backed by exotic spice, clove, sweet cinnamon and a touch of espresso bean.

Château Phélan-Ségur 2006  Saint-Estèphe,"In recent years, the Gardiniers of Phélan-Ségur seem to have become preoccupied with wood, generally too much. It's the same in 2006, and it is a shame, because everything else about this wine is balanced—the fruit is ripe and sweet and there is some freshness from a cranberry note. It just needs the wood to become less dominant.",88,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Estèphe,Bordeaux-style Red Blend-Saint-Estèphe

Duckhorn 2014 Merlot (Atlas Peak),"Burly and brawny in tar and leather, this muscular wine is showy and yet totally delicious.

Terra d'Oro 2015 Rosé (Amador County),"While light coral in color, this unusually rich and mouth-filling wine is flavorful, dry and smooth-textured.

Wildewood 2013 Guadalupe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Despite its single-vineyard designation, this watery effort could be from anywhere.

Serca 2014 Gran Corte Single Vineyard Red (Valle de Uco),"Ripe, lush berry and vanilla aromas announce this nicely oaked blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

Robert Young 2005 Scion Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A fine Cabernet that defines Alexander Valley's benchlands. It's entirely dry, a subtle wine whose herb-tinged blackberries, cherries and cedar turn increasingly complex in the glass.

Already throwing some sediment, so you might want to decant it before serving.",93,58.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon-Alexander Valley
Rocca delle Macìe 2009 Riserva di Fizzano  (Chianti Classico),"Made in a very respectable Chianti Classico style, the wine delivers freshness, with tart berry notes and a bright, streamlined feel.

Del Rio 2009 Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),"With alcohol at just 12.7%, this is one of several under-13% Pinots tasted recently that seem to be setting a new trend in Oregon.

Club Deluxe 2008 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Despite good vineyard sources, including DuBrul, Weinbau and Ciel du Cheval, this does not rise to the top ranks of Washington Cabernet Franc.

Domaine Charly Nicolle 2011 Mont de Milieu Premier Cru  (Chablis),"With its upfront, ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine is immediately attractive.

Chehalem 2013 Ridgecrest Vineyards Gamay Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit.

It finishes long, dry and bitter.",82,34.0,Cabernet Franc,Virginia,Cabernet Franc-Virginia
Cristiari 2013 Riesling (Costers del Segre),"This Riesling smells slightly tropical but more like grass and asparagus.

Domaine A. Cailbourdin 2014 Les Cris  (Pouilly-Fumé),"A full-bodied, ripe wine, this is going to develop well, with balanced acidity and ripe, perfumed apple and pear flavors.

Tandem 2006 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Tastes sweet, almost like a dessert wine.

Hogue 2008 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hogue's Late Harvest Riesling is an odd duck. In most usage, late harvest indicates a dessert-style wine with considerable sweetness.

Testarossa 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This Pinot has everything going for it. It's dry and tart in acidity, with a silky texture, yet rich in raspberries, cola, mint and sandalwood.

Louis Bernard 2009 Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"Bulky and rugged but sound, with some drying tannins on the finish.

Rosa d'Oro 2009 Estate Primitivo (Clear Lake),"Either this producer is one of the most honest when it comes to listing alcohol levels or this is as close to Port as it gets, a Primitivo that's got some cherry brightness to it, but gets bogged down by its own bigness.",85,20.0,Primitivo,Clear Lake,Primitivo-Clear Lake
Hartford 1999 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Hartford's blended Zin is filled with exuberant aromas of jammy “Zinberry” fruit, baking spices like cinnamon and clove, bittersweet chocolate and black pepper.

Pascal Doquet NV Le Mesnil sur Oger Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Mesnil sur Oger is at the pinnacle of Chardonnay in the Côte des Blancs of Champagne.

Domaine de Vaugondy 2015 Sec  (Vouvray),"This ripe, complex wine offers a delicate combination of apple, lemon and honey, with a mineral texture.

Col d'Orcia 2004 Olmaia Cabernet Sauvignon (Sant'Antimo),"Olmaia is a pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that hits all the right marks. You can taste the variety's natural flavors but they never seem green or medicinal. Instead the wine is plush, soft, round and opulent, with ideal harmony and balance and beautiful delivery of chocolate, cherry, vanilla and herbal aromas. The wine almost exaggerates, if possible, its generosity and roundness.",95,75.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sant'Antimo,Cabernet Sauvignon-Sant'Antimo
Siduri 2011 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The raspberry and cherry flavors are a bit obvious at first, but then the balanced tannins and acids become apparent, and the tasteful application of sweet, smoky oak surfaces.

Trimbach 2007 Clos Ste Hune Riesling (Alsace),"Clos Ste Hune comes from a small parcel in the Rosacker Grand Cru vineyard. It is a wonderful, ethereal paean to Riesling—crisp while intensely perfumed with aromas of fennel and licorice. It's dry in style, with elegant citrus flavors and a straight line of steely acidity, but finishes with a hint of honey. While delicious now, it's not quite mature and could continue to improve until 2025.",96,,Riesling,Alsace,Riesling-Alsace
Hook & Ladder 2009 The Tillerman Red (Russian River Valley),"Break out the pizza with tomato sauce and gooey, oily mozzarella.

Terre de Loups 2015 Les Landes Rosé (Saint-Chinian),"A coppery orange color, this opens with aromas of mealy melon, peach and strawberry.

At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey.

Patterson NV Due Anni Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The name references the two vintages blended together.

Drew 2012 Fog-Eater Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is lively, lean, and agile in style, from the fresh raspberry and cranberry aromas to the tangy raspberry flavors to the insistent tannins and firm acidity that frame it.

André Brunel 2007 Domaine de la Becassonne White (Côtes du Rhône),"Full bodied, but perhaps stretched a little beyond its limits, as the flavors of marmalade and honey seem to have difficulty covering the alcohol and bare stones. Drink up.",85,18.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Côtes du Rhône,Rhône-style White Blend-Côtes du Rhône
Domaine de la Mordorée 2013 La Reine Des Bois  (Tavel),"This is Mordorée's top cuvée of Tavel, and it earns that distinction by virtue of its length and stoniness on the finish.

Franco Conterno 2006 Vigna Pugnane  (Barolo),"Here's a vinous and youthful Barolo that definitely needs five-plus years of bottle aging.

Château Beauchêne 2016 Grande Réserve White (Côtes du Rhône),"For a plump, medium- to full-bodied wine, this is pungent and citrusy, with lemon and boxwood notes that give the impression of underripeness, despite the labeled alcohol.

Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2006 Artemis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made almost exclusively from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a deeply colored, ripely rich young wine that shows masses of blackberries. There are supporting notes of pain grillé, anise, violets, anise and smoky oak, with a firm grounding of minerals. Shows some tartness and astringency that strongly suggest time in the cellar. Try beyond 2012.",90,55.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon-Napa Valley
Bodega Noemía de Patagonia 2006 J. Alberto Malbec (Río Negro Valley),"A conflicted and hence confounding wine. The nose is very oaky, but it's a pointed, almost piercing wood and clove bouquet. The wine is fierce in the mouth, with kicking tannins and acidity pushing bulldozer-like blackberry and bitter espresso flavors. With 6% Merlot, this Patagonian Malbec has its virtues but isn't as friendly as past vintages.",87,40.0,Malbec,Río Negro Valley,Malbec-Río Negro Valley

Trio Vintners 2006 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"It's quite different from the winery's inaugural 2005 Sangiovese, with more sweet cranberry fruit and chewy, peppery tannins. It's got both muscle and spice, with a sweet, cotton candy core that is buttressed with the power of   the lengthy finish that adds layers of fat and cocoa.",87,20.0,Sangiovese,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sangiovese-Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Ramspur 2012 Otton Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Baked bread and brown sugar make this a comforting wine in some sense.

El Lugar 2016 Greengate Ranch & Vineyard Blanc Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"The slow-growing trend of white Pinot Noir finally landed on the Central Coast and Coby Parker-Garcia gives it a compelling argument in this bottling. Quite clear in the glass, and maybe the slightest bit pink, this shows crisp and clear aromas of orange blossoms, poached pear, sliced lime and rainy cement.

Naia 2010 Ducado de Altan Verdejo (Rueda),"This starts with some Verdejo sweat and funk on the nose, and while those notes don't last, the bouquet doesn't improve dramatically with airing.

J.R. Carter 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"For sheer palate seduction, you can't beat this rich wine. It used to be that Diamond Mountain Cabs weren't drinkable for years because of the tannins. Not so with this beauty. It shows pure, classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherry-pie filling, violets and sweet, smoky sandalwood, with a distinct minerality. Although it's beautiful now, it should develop in the bottle for a decade.",93,80.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon-Diamond Mountain District

Merlot adds softer notes of cherries and violets. The Malbec increases the tannins, along with notes of grilled meat bone that Syrah, with its peppery, beef-jerky meatiness, enhances.

Native Sun 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Made from Kiona Vineyards fruit, this Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon has the dark fruit and the dense tannins one might expect.

Ghost Pines 2013 Winemaker's Blend Pinot Noir (Sonoma County-Monterey County),"Damp forest and dried cherry with cranberry combine on the nose and palate in this wine, sourced predominantly from Monterey County.

La Posta 2006 Cocina Blend Red (Mendoza),"“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine.

Drink now.",87,15.0,Red Blend,Mendoza,Red Blend-Mendoza
Avenue 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"A bit herbal and brambly, with baked, earthy red fruit aromas.

Tarara 2010 CasaNoVA Merlot (Virginia),"The nose is packed with dark notes of desiccated strawberry, red currant and caramel lozenge, plus dried herb and maduro subtleties. Astringent, lip-grabbing tannins bolster the fleshy, medium- to full-bodied palate.

René Muré 2015 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"The heady aromatic scent of fresh tangerine peel takes turns with the refreshing perfume of green Seville oranges. The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now.

Iron Horse NV Joy! Sparkling (Green Valley),"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish. This is one to stash for the long haul.",97,147.0,Sparkling Blend,Green Valley,Sparkling Blend-Green Valley
Andreola Orsola NV Cartizze  (Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze),"This Cartizze Prosecco is a bit unusual in the sense that is it extremely tonic and focused in the mouth whereas other wines from this vineyard tend to be softer and more feminine.

Penner-Ash 2014 Zena Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"As with many of the winery's other single-vineyard selections from this vintage, this is strongly scented with fresh tobacco, and brings generous black-cherry fruit to the front and center.

Henri de Villamont 2014 Feusselottes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),"The tannins are linear and direct in this otherwise fruity wine. Along with dark tannins, it is also rich with warm red fruits.

Penley Estate 2008 Chertsey Red (Coonawarra),"In certain vintages, this wine can be excellent, but in 2008 it's merely good.

Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),"With its sweet wood, dense fruit and jammy character, this is a rich wine. It has some solid tannins, but they are almost lost in the welter of soft strawberry, nutmeg and juicy red berries. Typically with 2005, this is a wine whose opulence appeals now, but those tannins do suggest some good aging.",91,145.0,Pinot Noir,Vosne-Romanée,Pinot Noir-Vosne-Romanée
Michel Torino 2007 Rosé Malbec (Calchaquí Valley),"Given the dearth of good Argentinean rosés on the market, this one from Cafayate (based on Malbec) is pretty tasty, balanced and interesting.

Tulpen 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A Rhône blend that will, in future vintages, not be varietally named, this is far from a standard Washington Syrah. It's threaded beautifully with nuances of fruit and spice from the Viognier coferment, Grenache and Mourvèdre that are included. Aromatic, spicy and weaving together chocolate, licorice, granite, roasted meat and berry flavors, it is both substantial and forward.",92,20.0,Syrah,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah-Columbia Valley (WA)

Kaiken 2013 Mai Malbec (Mendoza),"Black in color, this smells of olive, eucalyptus and tarry berry, much like you'd get from a high-end Chilean red.

Domaine Don Gonzalo 2001 Private Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"Quite raisiny and pruny, from nose to palate to finish. But along the way there are touches of chocolate, earth, leather and cassis that help keep it afloat.

Mas d'en Gil 2012 Como Blanca White (Priorat),"Aromas of pear and cured meat are oxidized but also a touch harsh. This Garnacha Blanca and Macabeo blend weighs in as heavy and chunky.

Rita Hills),"This cool-climate bottling from the young producer shows tons of florality and spice, from violet and lilac to white pepper and dried herb, underscored by blueberry and tar aromas.

Bergström 2009 de Lancellotti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A concentrated core of pure, sweet raspberry and cherry fruit is showcased in a wine of remarkable penetration and length. The fruit, from a biodynamic estate vineyard, is perfumed and open, making this immediately accessible and supremely enjoyable.

Sbragia 2004 Rancho Del Oso Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Those mountain tannins are here in spades, and even though they're ripe and sweet, they give the wine a powerful astringency that demands cellaring.

It has a tense streak of acidity that cuts through the palate, leaving a balance of fruit and dry tannin.",87,19.0,Mansois,Marcillac,Mansois-Marcillac
Sextant 2010 Zinfandel (Central Coast),"This seems candy-sweet with flavors of raspberry, red licorice and spice. Simple, it is fine for everyday drinking.",84,16.0,Zinfandel,Central Coast,Zinfandel-Central Coast
SignoSeis 2012 The Angel Oak Rosé (Valle de Uco),"The wine shows a maderized color and aromas of oxidized stone fruits and rubber. This fast-fading rosé feels flat, with mushy flavors of peach, melon and mushroom. Bitterness rises up on the finish.",80,19.0,Rosé,Valle de Uco,Rosé-Valle de Uco
Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",95,55.0,Chardonnay,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay-Russian River Valley
Château Larteau 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur,"A ripe, full wine that has almost too much weight, it offers a very rich texture and firm tannins. The blackberry jelly fruits are dense and powered by a fruity feel. Drink from 2016.",86,17.0,Merlot,Bordeaux Supérieur,Merlot-Bordeaux Supérieur
Bertrand Ambroise 2006  St.-Romain,"A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.",87,35.0,Chardonnay,St.-Romain,Chardonnay-St.-Romain
Ogier 2013 Héritages White (Côtes du Rhône),"Modest apple and citrus aromas are clean and pleasant, and the same can be said of the flavors, which add hints of melon to the mix. The wine is plump and round in the mouth, but finishes long and crisp. This is a solid effort from this négociant house, which has never been a favorite here. Let's hope it's a positive indicator for the future.",87,16.0,Rhône-style White Blend,Côtes du Rhône,Rhône-style White Blend-Côtes du Rhône
Parducci 2010 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino),"Comprised of 55% Zinfandel, 30% Petite Sirah, 10% Syrah and 5% Grenache. Rich in juicy cinnamon and leather, this is a well-textured wine with structured acidity that's very drinkable. It finishes with an exuberant lengthening of blackberries and tar.

Morgan 2000 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Rich and complex, with an amazing array of flavors. Cherries, blackberries, spices, tobacco, soy, spicy cola and smoky oak are framed in luxuriously smooth, silky tannins and crisp acids.

Longboard 2012 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"A 100% varietal wine from a light-handed producer, this captures a sense of muted, yet juicy red cherry around structured tannins, making for an elegant experience.

Melville 2013 Donna's Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"There's a noticeable stemmy quality on the nose of this incredibly intriguing, almost mysterious wine, with green and pink peppercorns, crushed coffee beans and squeezed blueberry fruit aromas. A woodiness pervades the palate too, where roasted poblano chile meets with smoked cigar, lavender, dried berries and asphalt.

Drink at any point over the next few years.",88,11.0,Malbec,Mendoza,Malbec-Mendoza
Rutherford Hill 2012 Limited Release Chardonnay (Carneros),"Impressive for the price, because it's enormously rich, which makes it absolutely delicious to drink now.

Pacific Rim 2011 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The sweetness gauge on the back label indicates this as medium dry, and at 3.2% residual sugar, there is more than a hint of sweetness.

Yalumba 2006 Hand Picked Single Site Barty's Shiraz (Barossa),"With its aromas of smoke and cracked pepper, this shows more Rhône-ish qualities than many of its Barossa brethren. It's also less weighty than most, with an appealingly silky texture that fades just a little too quickly on the finish. Drink now–2015.",89,70.0,Shiraz,Barossa,Shiraz-Barossa

The fruit is clean and complex, ranging from watermelon to wild strawberry to pie cherry as it washes across the palate.

Château de Jurque 2016 Fantaisie  (Jurançon Sec),"This wine is young—full of acidity and rich yellow fruit. A blend of Petit and Gros Manseng, it has the typical honeyed edge yet is bone dry.

Woodward Canyon 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Plush and dusty, this splendid Merlot offers unusual depth and texture, even for Washington versions of the much-maligned grape.

Testarossa 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"One of the single-vineyard-focused winery's more affordable appellation blends, this is a plush, velvety wine with aromas of black cherry, cola, roasted fennel and a touch of graphite.

Ferngrove 2005 Symbols Shiraz-Viognier (Frankland River),"Ferngrove's entry-level Shiraz includes 5% Viognier, but it avoids any Viognier-derived stone-fruit character, instead yielding up savory spice scents, a hint of mint and ripe blackberry and plum flavors.

Kiona 2010 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled Columbia Valley, this is in fact 100% Merlot from the estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's chewy and tannic, as is often the case with Red Mountain reds, with black cherry and cassis fruit wrapped by astringent tannins hinting at dark chocolate.

Byington 2014 Ventana Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),"Extremely grassy on the nose, this also shows lime juice and a skunky cannabis character that starts to blow off with time.

Feral, leathery, roasted-berry aromas require patience. In the mouth, this is tannic and muscular, with herbal, spicy, dry flavors of blackberry and stewed plum.

Daedalus Cellars 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Fragrant and soft, this nicely oaked Pinot Noir offers cherry, cola, mocha and toast flavors.

Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally.

D'Argenzio 2003 L Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Unusual for a 2003 Cab to be held back this long before release. Maybe they thought the tannins were too strong.

The palate adds a generous if frothy creaminess to these flavors, making them fizz and fill the mouth with their fruity freshness.

Chateau Ste. Michelle 2015 Cold Creek Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Still settling into the bottle, this wine is aromatically quiet, with notes of white flowers and pear.

Portalupi 2012 Shake Ridge Barbera (Amador County),"Very seductive and flavorful, this smells like a bushel of ripe blackberries and raspberries, and tastes exotic, generous and full of dark fruit notes.

Fayolle Fils & Fille 2009 Clos les Cornirets  (Crozes-Hermitage),"Élevage in one-third new oak has imparted toast, vanilla and cedar aromas and given the texture of this wine a plush edge, but the quality of the underlying fruit and the length of the finish are undeniable. The primary blackberry fruit should develop hints of coffee and black olive in short order; drink 2013–2019.",90,42.0,Syrah,Crozes-Hermitage,Syrah-Crozes-Hermitage
Michel Torino 2009 Don David Reserve Chardonnay (Cafayate),"Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon.

Robert Klingenfus 2013 Bruderthal Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Rather perfumed, lifted notes of honeysuckle and the full force of lemon-drizzled honeydew melon make for a striking opening.

Snoqualmie 2015 ECO Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas on this wine are surprisingly blue fruited for a Cabernet, followed by notes of herb, green pepper and spice.

Cobblestone 2005 Cobblestone Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Clearly well-origined, to judge from the fine structure and essential purity. But it's a very tannic, closed wine, with a mouth-numbing astringency that accentuates the acidity. Even so, it's so ripe in blackberries and currants it's almost drinkable now, with a good decant. But you're best off cellaring a good 4–6 years.",90,69.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon-Napa Valley
Signorello 2012 Estate Grown and Bottled Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This powerful wine that also holds 5% Cabernet Franc shyly packs a punch.

Château Suduiraut 2011  Sauternes,"Very fresh and strongly fruity, with just the right amount of dry botrytis, this is already approachable.

Argiano 2010 Solengo Red (Toscana),"This oak-dominated wine recalls the ubiquitous wood-driven Tuscan offerings from the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Carlisle 2013 Pagani Ranch Alicante Bouschet (Sonoma Valley),"The fact that this variety is still in the ground in the county says something; the fact that's it's still in the confines of Pagani Ranch says even more.

Damilano 2005 Cannubi  (Barolo),"This vintage of Damilano's Cannubi cru Barolo is very impressive. Chocolate fudge and hazelnut are lavished over very good integrity of fruit.

Roessler 2004 Wiley Vineyard Riesling (Anderson Valley),"Far better known as a Pinot Noir producer, Roessler has released this dry Riesling from 25-year-old vines, and it's a terrifically interesting, distinctive California white wine. At 4 years of age, it's bone dry, showing crisp, vibrant Anderson Valley acidity, and is showing the oily, diesel, peach, honeysuckle and hazelnut flavors of a maturing, Alsatian-style Riesling. Should continue to develop bottle complexity for another decade.",90,18.0,Riesling,Anderson Valley,Riesling-Anderson Valley
Finca Albret 2009 Crianza Red (Navarra),"Everything about this lighter-framed Navarran blend is an echo of when European red wines were racy and crisp as opposed to big, extracted, dark and woody. With fresh raspberry aromas, zesty acidity and earthy flavors of red berry and spice offset by cocoa and vanilla, this is akin to Bordeaux and it should go nicely with most kinds of food.",88,16.0,Red Blend,Navarra,Red Blend-Navarra

Williams Selyem 2010 Vista Verde Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County),"The raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors are delicious, and the oak brings just the right touch of sweet, smoky toast.

Torbreck 2010 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon.

Château Lagrézette 2015 Le Pigeonnier White Vision Viognier (Côtes du Lot),"The wine comes from a single, high-elevation vineyard owned by Château Lagrézette.

Savage Grace 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"An immediately appealing wine with notes of freshly cut apple, apricot, mineral and jasmine. Though it has 17 g/L residual sugar, it drinks barely off dry with the vineyard's electric acidity more than balancing out the midpalate's sugar, providing a dry feel to the drawn-out finish.

Celler Cooperatiu de Gandesa 2013 Somdinou Red (Terra Alta),"This blend of Carignan, Garnacha and other red grapes opens with stewy, herbal, slightly weedy plum aromas.

Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours.",93,24.0,Riesling,Alsace,Riesling-Alsace

Château de Tracy 2014 Haute Densité  (Pouilly-Fumé),"This wine comes from a parcel that is planted at a superhigh density of nearly 7,000 plants per acre.

The Williamsburg Winery 2006 Adagio Merlot (Virginia),"A beautiful dark plum color and elegant aromas of cherry, allspice and pepper lead this Virginia Merlot.

Sobon Estate 2008 Old Vines Zinfandel (Amador County),"Very dense and layered in grilled cherry, raspberry, cocoa, spice and cola flavors, this full-bodied wine needs rich barbecues and stews to tame its bigtime tannins.

Syncline 2006 Cinsault (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is a pretty, pale purple/rose; bright, peppery and rather delicate. It shows excellent floral aspects, like a good Beaujolais - it's somewhere between Pinot Noir and Gamay, with big fat grapes and heavy clusters that somehow produce a real finesse wine.

City Winery of New York 2011 Obsidian Ridge Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"A few years of aging may help this full-bodied, very structured and tannic Cabernet smooth out and gain more complexity. Alternatively, pour it now with something rich like a grilled rosemary lamb chop. It feels tight because of the dense, lip-smacking tannins, yet it does pack in considerable ripe plum, smoke and tobacco flavors.

Henry Fessy 2012  Chiroubles,"This structured wine discloses dark tannins and a firm, dense character. The granite soil comes through strongly in the cool minerality and tight texture.

Waters 2006 Forgotten Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"From 10-year-old vines at a vineyard in the foothills of the Blue Mountains east of town, this is a lush and loamy Syrah, smelling and tasting of moist earth, game and blood. There are some roasted tomato flavors along with light red fruits, but this is no wimpy wine; in fact, it gathers strength and concentration as it sits in the mouth, suggesting that it needs more years in the bottle to fully emerge from its shell.",90,40.0,Syrah,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah-Walla Walla Valley (WA)
Château des Annibals 2005 Fesse-Mathieux Red (Coteaux Varois),"Aromas of dried cloves and adhesive bandages will be a bit offputting to some tasters, but the bones of this wine are solid, offering supple tannins and blackberry, hickory and black cherry flavors.

Helwig 2012 Petite Sirah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Very impressive color, fruit concentration and tannic structure add up to an outstanding Petite Sirah. What's compelling is that this full-bodied wine seems to get its character purely from the concentrated and tannin-laden grapes rather than from new oak barrels or add-ins.

Bodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Rosado Rosé (Rioja),"Maderized and stalky smelling, with a scratchy palate and grassy, pickled flavors that lean toward strawberry and raspberry.",80,10.0,Rosé,Rioja,Rosé-Rioja
Albert Bichot 2010 Domaine du Pavillon Les Santenots Premier Cru  (Volnay),"Typical of Volnay, this wine has a velvety character that surrounds the firm tannins. The acidity is palpable through the warm red-berry flavors and firm edge.

Sweet Cheeks 2012 Pinot Fusion Red (Oregon),"The Fusion in question is the blend—an unusual combination of 61% Pinot Noir, 21% Syrah and 18% Merlot.

The jumble of red fruits is matched to a strong streak of vanilla, with some stemmy flavors coming up in the tannins.",84,18.0,Red Blend,Oregon,Red Blend-Oregon
Fogdog 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Good and rich, but a bit ungainly. Sharpness makes it tart, and the oak stands out, shoving the cherry, currant, plum and cola flavors aside. These may be the marks of an immature wine, but it is very difficult to forecast this Pinot's future. On the assumption that balance now equals balance later, it's probably not an ager.",87,35.0,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir-Sonoma Coast
Carlisle 2015 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"The great majority of this wine is made from old-vine grapes, planted pre-Prohibition. The age tells tales of soft leathery chewiness on the palate as swathes of cherry-syrup flavor make for a hearty velvety explosion that's lengthy and rich. Black licorice plays a part.",91,30.0,Zinfandel,Sonoma County,Zinfandel-Sonoma County
FEL 2013 Donnelly Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Reserved fruit aromas like cherry compote come with substantial accents of cinnamon and clove.

Domaine de Courteillac 2009  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This is a full, ripe wine, with tannins that are already well integrated into the red fruits. It's rich and full, packed with delicious ripeness.

A touch of alcoholic heat marks the finish.",87,35.0,Gewürztraminer,Finger Lakes,Gewürztraminer-Finger Lakes
Tempus Cellars 2011 Evergreen Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Another successful vintage for this wine, it maintains a clean, well-defined mouthfeel that barely registers the 1.3% residual sugar.

Tapiz 2008 Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Rather flat and oily smelling, resulting in a low-pulse bouquet. The mouth is wet and chunky as it features sweet mango and cantaloupe flavors. Orange candy and sweetness is about all you get on the finish.",82,16.0,Chardonnay,Mendoza,Chardonnay-Mendoza
Collosorbo 2009 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of stewed fruit, prune and hay lead the nose on this brawny wine.

Viña Cobos 2010 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Chardonnay (Perdriel),"A big, warm style of Chard. The nose is soft, toasty and loaded with butter, baked apple and vanilla aromas.

Tablas Creek 2013 Estate Vermentino (Paso Robles),"The first sniffs of this Vermentino—which Tablas Creek's French vineyard consultant suggested planting because of Paso Robles' rocky limestone soils—recall a hot day at the beach, with ocean spray salinity and hot sand aromas. Once sipped, the beach turns to a refreshing, watered-down orange juice experience, with a hint of lemon-lime on the finish. Pair with any fresh fish.",88,27.0,Vermentino,Paso Robles,Vermentino-Paso Robles
Viticcio 2007  Chianti Classico,"This is a vinous-smelling wine that recalls the sweet berry aromas you would naturally find in the wine cellar.

Nine North Wine Company 2010 Seven Sinners Petite Sirah (Lodi),"Decadent in coffee, toffee and caramel tones, the leathery mouthfeel of this wine is met head-to-head by a juiciness of ripe, dense blackberry fruit.

Foley 2013 JA Ranch Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Eucalyptus leaf, black raspberry and black cherry aromas combine for a sultry nose on this bottling, one of this producer's many expressions of individual sites in the region.

Whitcraft 2011 Pence Ranch Clone 828 Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"A deliciously likeable Pinot Noir, sweet as a raspberry crumble pie, yet with qualities of mushrooms, minerals and something formidable from the earth that give it great complexity. The winemaker, Drake Whitcraft, has kept the alcohol to a relatively low 13.4% by volume, so the wine feels light and airy. Yet it possesses great seriousness. The vineyard is within a touchdown pass of the Santa Rita Hills boundary. Drink now–2020.",92,50.0,Pinot Noir,Santa Ynez Valley,Pinot Noir-Santa Ynez Valley
Fabre Montmayou 2005 Phebus Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Phebus is a new label from Fabre Montmayou, and frankly this wine has issues. It smells a lot like gumballs and a wet, dirty dog. It doesn't have much substance or flow, and that gamy, wet-dog character is persistent, even on the flavor profile.",80,14.0,Malbec,Mendoza,Malbec-Mendoza
Jean-Michel Sorbe 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Reuilly),"This is a perfumed, fruity wine.

Hatcher 2006 Petite Sirah (Calaveras County),"Dark, tannic and dense, this is a classic Petite Sirah. In its youth it's strongly flavored in black currants and chocolate, and will be fine with richly sauced barbecue. But it will age for many, many years, gradually softening.",88,26.0,Petite Sirah,Calaveras County,Petite Sirah-Calaveras County
Chanoine NV Tzarina No 1 Brut  (Champagne),"A rich, bottled-aged wine, full of toast as well as apple and crisp grapefruit flavors, this has great balance and elegance.

Domaine de Ballade 2014 Ballade Rosé (Côtes de Gascogne),"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a full-bodied wine. It has a light tannic character over intense acidity.

Sterling 1999 Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a big-boned beauty of a Merlot. Impresses with the sheer size of its fruity-berry flavors and lovely, rich tannins.

Albert Bichot 2014 Domaine du Pavillon  (Meursault),"Firmly touched by wood, this is a rich and also structured wine.

Santa Julia 2013 [+] Malbec (Mendoza),"Dense berry aromas are a bit flat and medicinal. Expect a juicy, direct palate with hard plum and berry flavors that are also a touch briny/salty.

Peña Roble 2006  Ribera del Duero,"Fairly obvious vanilla and dill aromas work with red-fruit and resin scents to give this a “roble” sort of nose, meaning the oak is definitely there.

Torbreck 2007 The Pict Mataro (Barossa Valley),"After recently tasting a knockout bottle of the 2005, this was disappointing.

Schramsberg 2011 Methode Traditionelle Brut Sparkling (Carneros),"This sparkler was made from a majority of Chardonnay with a seasoning of Pinot Noir, the grapes grown at Hyde Vineyard, among other sites within the appellation.

Reininger 2005 Seven Hills Vineyard Carmenère (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine greets you with evocative scents that showcase Carmenère's leafy, herbal nature without becoming too raw or vegetal.

Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Windsbuhl Pinot Gris (Alsace),"A hint of flinty reduction still plays on the nose, barely letting any of the pure fruit notes escape but both ripe and crisp pear appear. The palate still shows some yeasty funk but convinces with purity, sheer power and concentration. This feels urgent and direct, strong and stony, boisterous with sheer force and drive.

Château de Ricaud 2010 Réserve des Coteaux  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),"A fruity, structured wine, dense and dark-hued, its black currant fruits giving a sense of lighter acidity.

Circe 2016 Verdejo (Rueda),"After opening with white fruit and mineral aromas, this shows a sticky palate made fatter by low acidity.

Domaine Saint-Nabor 2016 Chardonnay (Pays d'Oc),"Mealy apple and orange custard aromas set the stage for this ripe, fleshy white.

Château Peyfaures 2010 Dame de Coeur  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"Hugely ripe Merlot is at the core of this rich wine. It is opulent, rounded and packed with dark plum-juice flavors.

Labouré-Roi 2008 Les Chevaliers  (Meursault),"Full and buttery, as befits a Meursault, the wine also has a fine-textured acidity, spice and toast.

It's unusual for a sparkling wine house to hold back their basic vintage brut this long, but J did, and consumers benefit.

Clos du Val 2004 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The '04 is close to the '03 in quality, but falls off in structure, no doubt due to the hot vintage. It's a little too soft to balance the cola and cherry-pie filling flavors. Still, it's elegant.",87,46.0,Pinot Noir,Carneros,Pinot Noir-Carneros

Nine Hats 2016 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine's aromas are surprisingly reserved for the variety, with faint peach, lime and mandarin orange notes.

Matthews 2003 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has rich tannins, dense fruit and overall deep flavors. This is a dark wine, just this side of brooding, with ripe blueberry and cherry fruit, softly chalky tannins, whiffs of smoke and splashes of pepper. The dark fruit flavors are bold and seamless, melded with smoke and chocolate, dotted with ground espresso, and finished with a nice lift.

Breaux 2009 Marquis de Lafayette Cabernet Franc (Virginia),"A smoky narcissus note is upfront and almost obtrusive, with brooding notes of spiced black fruit and char lurking in the background.

Erath 2007 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A big step up from the disappointing 2006, this value-priced Pinot combines genuine Pinot Noir varietal character with a restrained elegance more typical of Burgundy than Oregon.

Château Saint-Didier-Parnac 2009 Prieuré de Cenac Malbec (Cahors),"Almost black in color, this medicinal, bitter chocolate flavored wine is completely dominated by wood at this stage.

Three Rivers 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This marks a change in style from Three Rivers's 2010, with noticeably less new oak influence and a much smaller production.

Nefarious 2008 Rocky Mother Vineyard Estate Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is Syrah from the far northwest corner of the Columbia Valley, a cool region, whose wines show an underlying minerality. The berry flavors are subtle; this is a mélange of leaf, herb, rock and acid. Still young, the tannins are drying and the wine seems to be entering a dumb phase.

Phillips Hill 2010 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"Made in a more extracted, fuller style, this is overwhelmingly earthy and intensely aromatic.

Claar 2006 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a bit stinky right out of the bottle, with some sour, rotten egg aromas.

Tierra Roja 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon grown on the vintner's estate, this wine is holding back some of its complexity now in lieu of aging potential.

Contrade di Taurasi 2003 Riserva  (Taurasi),"This hot vintage Riserva offers dense aromas of black fruit and pomegranate but there's also a touch of the proverbial barnyard or Band-Aid that distracts from the big picture. The wine has raw, gritty tannins and thick extraction.",85,,Aglianico,Taurasi,Aglianico-Taurasi

Helwig 2013 Rosé de Shenandoah Rosé (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Think of a pink version of Beaujolais Nouveau.

Korbin Kameron 2007 Cuvée Kristin Estate Blend Red (Sonoma Valley),"Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors.

This one is wonderfully rich, rounded and aromatic with long-lasting flavors.",92,40.0,Gewürztraminer,Alsace,Gewürztraminer-Alsace
Fritz 1998 Dutton Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality.

Francis Berwyn 2006 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Not particularly Petite Sirah-like, because it's not a big, huge, tannic wine that needs a long time to come around. But it is a marvelously good red for drinking now at a fair price. Drily tannic and polished, it has deep flavors of fresh, crushed ripe blackberries and cherries, with a delicious edge of pepper and chocolate.",88,13.0,Petite Sirah,Paso Robles,Petite Sirah-Paso Robles

Baldacci 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Almost as perfect a Stags Leap Cabernet as you can find, showing lush, opulent and immediately appealing flavors. Blackberries, plums, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet oak combine in a spicy swirl. The tannins are fiercely soft, an oxymoron that suggests the wine's complexity. Yet those same tannins are astringent enough to warrant time in the cellar. Hold until 2014, at least.",94,65.0,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon-Stags Leap District

The fruit is perfectly ripe, clean and expansive, running from apple into light tropical flavors.

Loron et Fils 2014 Château de Mirande  (Mâcon-Villages),"Ripe with tropical-fruit flavors, this wine has good acidity layered with spice and toastiness.

Lamborn Family Vineyards 2008 Vintage VI Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, crème de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar.

Harmonique 2007 Elegancé Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Textured in bold cranberry and strawberry fruit, this older Pinot still offers plenty of fruit and weight, though neither will necessarily last much longer.

This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years.

Dunning Vineyards 2012 Westside Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"The nose on this wine from the Willow Creek area plays between the lighter elements of bright red cherries and heavier hints of tar, with a bit of sour plum thrown in as well.

Bouvet-Ladubay NV Rubis Excellence Demi-Sec Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),It makes sense to produce this red sparkling wine in a medium-dry form.

Domaine Laroche 2012 Les Fourneaux Premier Cru  (Chablis),"The wine is from a premier cru that is off the main Serein river valley. It's tight and mineral in character, very crisp and crunchy.

Livius 2008 Garnacha  (Rioja),"A nose with oxidized baked-fruit aromas confirms that this 2008 is on the back side of its run.

Prune and baking-spice flavors control a soft, mature finish.",86,75.0,Garnacha,Rioja,Garnacha-Rioja
Terre del Principe 2010 Piancastelli Red (Terre del Volturno),"This thick, extracted wine is made from 70% Pallagrello and 30% Casavecchia grapes, a portion of which was overripened on the vine.

Columbia Crest 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though it lacks the broad, sweet fruit of the 2005 reserve, this is a fine reflection of the vintage. It's compact, tannic, and a bit unyielding, but structured with enough density to age for a few years.

Waits-Mast 2014 Mariah Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"This medium-bodied wine has a relatively light-garnet color and a touch of cloudiness that is accompanied by complex and attractive aromas blending cinnamon, clove, rhubarb and light wood smoke.

Inspire Moore 2009 LUST Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"Striking acidity adds freshness to more rustic characteristics of cooked red fruit, caramelized sugar and hay on this medium-bodied Pinot.

Cruz Alta 2006 Grand Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"A blend of charred oak and violets lead the bouquet, which also offers some floral berry.

Stefano Accordini 2006 Le Bessole  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Here's a subdued and elegant Amarone that whispers rather than screams.

Domaine Alfred 2006 Chamisal Vineyards Califa Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"This limited-production bottling shows its cool-climate origins in the high acidity and barely-ripened flavors of cherries and rhubarb that have a slightly green, minty edge.

Château Potelle 2007 VGS Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Extraordinarily concentrated in blackberries, blueberries and black currants.

Velocity 2007 Red Wine Red (Rogue Valley),"With each successive vintage, winemaker Gus Janeway has slowly but surely moved this wine to 100% Malbec. It's a bold step, because pure varietal wines do not have the advantage of filling in holes with blending.

Arbor Crest 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is very fresh and nicely detailed, with just 13% alcohol allowing some of the more subtle Sauvignon Blanc flavors to show. Some of the oldest vines in the state—more than 35 years old—are a prime component.

Clos Berenguer del Molar 2013 Vinya les Sorts Cabernet Sauvignon (Priorat),"Initial aromas of damp earth and coffee grounds are a bit misleading because this tastes almost entirely of ripe, slightly baked black fruits. This is a massive Cabernet-based wine with severely scratchy tannins. On the finish, rugged leftover tannins are like gravel, while this is saturated in a familiar Priorat way.

Marimar Estate 2012 Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard Unfiltered Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Not much of this wine is made and that's a shame.

Bailiwick 2010 Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Light and silky, this packs a real punch in complexity, with layers of raspberry, cherry, cola and sweet oak.

Morgan 2006 Highland Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Those familiar with Morgan's more expensive Chardonnays, such as the Double L (which comprises 55% of this blend) will find true value in this regional wine.

Pascal Jolivet 2014 Le Roc  (Sancerre),"This wine comes from a single vineyard, planted on flint soil. It has a definite steely character that has been softened by the year in bottle.

While this wine doesn't show the greatest of ease and flow on the palate, flavors of plum, cassis, clove and cinnamon are persuasive.

Spann Vineyards 2004 Twenty-Three Barrels Mo Jo Red (Sonoma County),"Sweeter than in the past, this blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Cab Franc has overtly sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling that are not appropriate in a table wine.",80,40.0,Red Blend,Sonoma County,Red Blend-Sonoma County
Barton 2014 Jurassic Park Vineyard Chenin Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A fairly rich take on this grape, which many wineries use from this particular vineyard, this bottling is flush with white peach and white melon aromas, cut by lime and dried lemon blossoms, and layered with intriguing kiwi and exotic citrus notes. The palate is more simple, with apple and lemon flavors and chalky texture.",88,22.0,Chenin Blanc,Santa Ynez Valley,Chenin Blanc-Santa Ynez Valley
Westerly 2010 Fletcher's Red Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),A balance of blueberry-chiffon ripeness and asphalt tightness is enhanced by spearmint and cola notes on the nose of this blend from eastern Santa Ynez Valley.

Airfield Estates 2006 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Strawberry fruit is set against some pretty stiff tannins; it seems to have over-reached in color and extract, given the rather lean fruit. Leafy, herbal and a bit off-kilter.",83,22.0,Merlot,Yakima Valley,Merlot-Yakima Valley
Two Sisters 2008 Courtney's Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Chardonnay doesn't get much riper or richer than this.

Kilikanoon 2013 Blocks Road Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),"Parts of Clare Valley are ideal for Cabernet Sauvignon, illustrated by this reasonably priced bottling.

Bridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast),"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.",90,25.0,Syrah,Central Coast,Syrah-Central Coast

MacPhail 2012 Rita's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This small, Sonoma County-focused producer headed south to make a rich, attention-grabbing wine, with aromas of dark raspberries, blackberries, pulverized cloves, black sage and tobacco leaf.

Rita Hills,Pinot Noir-Sta. Rita Hills
Marco de Bartoli 2011 Grappoli del Grillo (Sicilia),"From the firm whose iconic founder was the first to vinify and bottle 100% Grillo, this structured wine is fermented with native yeasts and aged in French oak barrels of varying size.

Jim Barry 2012 The Lodge Hill Dry Riesling (Clare Valley),"The Lodge Hill Dry is a solid performer year-in and year-out.

Giuseppe Rinaldi 2012 Tre Tine  (Barolo),"Red berry, tilled soil, leather, aromatic herb and clove aromas slowly take shape in the glass, together with a balsamic note.

Manyana 2015 Tempranillo (Cariñena),"Medicinal berry aromas show a touch of nail polish. Tight and high in acidity, this deals limited plum flavors with earthy undertones. A short finish is grapy in flavor but doesn't last long despite acidic push.",85,10.0,Tempranillo,Cariñena,Tempranillo-Cariñena
Iron Horse 2010 National Geographic Ocean Reserve Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Green Valley),"Formidable acidity gives this lovely wine a freshness around complementary layers of rose petal and strawberry-pomegranate.

Adelsheim 2014 Calkins Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Plum and cherry fruit notes combine here, feeling concentrated through the midpalate.

Bodega Catena Zapata 2006 Adrianna Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful.

Pride Mountain 2012 Viognier (Sonoma County),"This is one of those Viogniers that's flashy and extravagant. If you're a Chardophile, it brings the same creamy, oaky sweetness and lifts it into the stratosphere, with scads of tropical fruits, sweet ripe pears, honeysuckle flowers, vanilla, brown sugared and cinnamon. Viognier hardly gets richer. Drink now.",91,42.0,Viognier,Sonoma County,Viognier-Sonoma County

Dutton Estate 2006 Dutton Ranch Dutton Palms Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"They used wild yeasts to ferment this Chard, and there is something exotic and feral about the flavors, which go beyond nectarines and pears into fruits without names.

Chavet Fils 2014  Menetou-Salon,"Still young, this wine has a tight character that needs to open up. Since there is plenty of fruit along with perfumed acidity, it will happen.

The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious.

Hendry 2007 Hendry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is very strong in blackberries, black currants and cedar. It's also quite tannic.

Talley 2006 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"There's a fine Pinot Noir in the bottle, but it needs a little time to come around. Tasted in the Fall of 2008, it was a bit hard in tannins, which masked the fruit. But there's a polished core of wild blackberries, cherries, cola and red plums that suggest aging through 2009, if you can keep your hands off it.",91,32.0,Pinot Noir,Edna Valley,Pinot Noir-Edna Valley

Dumas Station 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This Right Bank-styled blend includes 19% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Despite its high (15.3%) alcohol, it's a meaty, complex wine that drinks much lighter.

Lamborn Family Vineyards 2007 Vintage V Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"So dramatically deep in flavor, it immediately impresses for the depth of blackberries, cassis and minerals, enriched with sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are fierce now, and the wine shows a precocious immaturity that makes it somewhat coarse. But it clearly has the structure to age well.

Fielding Hills 2009 RiverBend Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"Surprisingly, this seems quite light at first, with strawberry and cranberry fruit flavors, and a fair amount of acidity.

Schramsberg 2000 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast),"Right up there with the recent string of fabulous têtes de cuvées, the 2000 shows the concentration, power and subtlety of this, the winery's top release. A blend of Chardonnay with 20% Pinot Noir, it shows exotic and complex flavors of tangerines and raspberries, candied ginger, coconut macaroons, baked bread and yeast. It's delicious now, but all the parts haven't come together. Hold until mid-2008 through 2010, but could go well beyond that.",94,90.0,Sparkling Blend,North Coast,Sparkling Blend-North Coast
Big Basin 2012 Coastview Vineyard Syrah (Monterey County),"Plump black currant, lavender extract, bright purple flowers and touches of raw beef and tar show on the nose of this bottling, made with 20% whole-cluster and 7% Viognier.

Henry's Drive Vignerons 2008 Dead Letter Office Shiraz (McLaren Vale-Padthaway),"Although this starts off showing loads of vanilla and bright, boysenberry-like fruit, this is not a simple fruity concoction; there's some elegance here, and some savory notes of coffee and roasted meat as well.

Dolin 2012 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The Malibu-based winery's take on this Miller family vineyard—which sits at the appellation's western edge—is intriguingly complex, with aromatic layers of clove, raspberry, vanilla bean and dried rose hips.

Mount Pleasant Winery 2006 Norton (Missouri),"Ambitious and concentrated, with an inky color and a juicy, mouthwatering palate framed by mature blackberry and raspberry fruit.
